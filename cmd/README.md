A boilerplate for a cloudgene application that contains a workflow with several command-line programs.

This is a minimal and ready-to-run application which can be used to start your own projects.

A new cloudgene appliation based on this boilerplate can be created by typing the following command:

```
cgapps init --app myapp --boilerplate boilerplates/cmd
```

This command creates a folder myapp which contains all needed files.
